# Day 2

### Topics to learn

- Structure folders so each resource/path has it's own folder, so instead of doing a switch statement to find the right
file, we can just use the file path e.g. requests resource is /money, so file should be in webserver/money
- How requests made by a socket are different to browser (HTTP) requests
- Spend a short amount of time trying to pass a variable to the HTML file e.g. 10 - 15mins
    - Idea is to see if we can figure out how it's done
    - Look at how jinja works underneath
